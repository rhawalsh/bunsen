# Custom jinja2 filter select_install(specification, selection).

# Inputs are:
#   specification:  an installation options specification
#   selection:      attributes to use in selecting from the specification
#
# Example selection:
#   { "distribution" : "RedHat81",
#     "architecture" : "s390x",
#     "environment"  : ["python2"] }
#
# None of the selection values are required, though without distribution the
# list of selections returned will be only those common to all distributions,
# if identified, from the specification.
