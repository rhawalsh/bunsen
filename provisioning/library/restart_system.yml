# This is a separate file because we may trigger reboots from two
# places, and we may need to tweak this a bit to get it to work right,
# since it involves losing our connection to the target machine etc.

# Note that Ansible 2.7 has a "reboot" module, but Fedora 28 ships
# with Ansible 2.6.5. (CSB is RHEL 7.4 with 2.4.2.0.) Perhaps once we
# can assume 2.7 we can use that and drop this file.

# Some recommended advice from the net uses "sleep 5 && reboot" with
# "async: 1" and "poll: 0" to trigger the reboot, which worked with
# RHEL 7.5, but doesn't seem to work with Fedora 28. We don't know why
# yet.
