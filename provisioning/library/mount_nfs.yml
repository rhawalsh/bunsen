# Task list for mounting an NFS directory and verifying that the mount worked.
# The standard Ansible "mount" module will update the system fstab and will
# attempt the mount, but if the mount fails, sometimes it will continue on. We
# don't want that behavior, so we verify each mount.
#
# Input vars: name, src, extra_opts (optional)
#   extra_opts gets workaround_nfs_mount_opts added
#
# Modifies:
#   ansible_mounts
